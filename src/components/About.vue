  <div class="about">
      <p>Create a Single-page application (SPA) in Vue.js implementing a simple Todo list. The application should follow
        the Flux/Redux architecture principles in terms of app state management and uni-directional data flow. A
        sample Vue.js project can be created via vue-cli</p>

      Your application should be able to maintain a Todo list of activities:
        <ul>
            <li>- adding an activity (item to the list),</li>
            <li>- updating the activity (toggle status between completed/not completed),</li>
            <li>- delete an activity, and</li>
            <li>- list all the activities when the page is first loaded or reloaded*</li>
        </ul>
  </div>
